# AI2-41 / #99 — Claude mods enforcement probe

2026-10-03, Codex. Branch: `codex/claude-mods-enforcement-probe`.

Completed: real Claude Code 2.1.288 + released ai2rules 0.6.0 probe, twice in
fresh temporary roots. Project PreToolUse emits deny; a narrowly matched
user-tier tool.check mod sees deny and returns allow; the native Write creates
the marker. Control writes; no-mod project denial prevents the write.

Evidence and reproduction: `docs/benchmarks/claude-mods/README.md`, `probe.py`,
`results/project-2.1.288.json`. Final run passed all effect and decision checks.
The model API is scripted/loopback; the host, hooks, kernel and effect are real.
No production policy or adapter behavior was changed. README/PLAN qualify scope.

Next commit-sized step: reproduce genuine managed PreToolUse with mod off/on
in a disposable container/VM, preserving the same call and policy. Record
loaded sec-default and actual scope. Managed cases are NOT RUN; no isolated
managed-policy test setup was provisioned in this slice. Do not relabel
project/CLI settings as managed. Do not start a guard implementation.

Done for next step: both managed cases have pinned configuration, live adapter
response and marker-effect evidence; report/trackers updated. Full issue stays
open while those rows are missing. Consult linked PR and both trackers before
continuing. No live prompt-injection or persistence claim is established.
