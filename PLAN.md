# ai2rules — Execution Plan

High-level execution plan for building the harness specified in
[`docs/harness-architecture.md`](docs/harness-architecture.md): a deterministic
governance kernel that sits underneath a local CLI developer agent (Claude Code,
Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Aider, …) and controls what the agent can perceive, what
actions it can represent, and what validated specs may cross into real execution.

This document is the **epic-level roadmap only**. Each epic lists its goal,
dependencies, constituent tasks, and exit criteria. Detailed task breakdown
(issues, estimates, owners, acceptance tests per task) is deliberately deferred —
see [Next step](#next-step).

Speculative, research-grade ideas that aren't committed work live in the idea pool
at [`docs/RESEARCH-BACKLOG.md`](docs/RESEARCH-BACKLOG.md) — promote one here when it's
ready to become an epic.

---

## North star

A developer can run the harness against the default world and have it drive a
real model through file edits, commands, patches, MCP tools, and web fetches —
where every dangerous action is *absent or denied by construction*, every
decision is *deterministic and replayable*, and no LLM sits on the enforcement
path. Success is measured by the [16 acceptance invariants](#acceptance-invariant-coverage)
passing deterministically in CI, with bounded attack-success-rate and high task
utility on a benchmark suite.

## Delivery model & packaging

ai2rules ships as **infrastructure, not an application**: a governance engine that always
wraps a host the user already runs (think **OPA / seccomp for agent actions**) —
standalone in *form*, plugin in *role*. The "custom standalone agent" ambition is **cut**
as a product (`DECISIONS.md` **D31**); the `cli-harness` CLI / E9 TUI remain a dev & demo
harness, not the shipped artifact. Full rationale, user segments, and "install → get"
walkthroughs: [`docs/USE-CASES.md`](docs/USE-CASES.md).

**🔝 Immediate priority (2026-06-28): E16 — internal demo on the hosts the team actually
uses.** A governed **JIRA MCP** capability surface for **GitHub Copilot** (VS Code +
JetBrains) **and Claude Code**, via the Safe MCP Proxy. This brings the MCP-proxy surface
(#2 below) forward as the fastest path to a live, host-agnostic proof; see
`DECISIONS.md` **D32** and **E16**.

**Ship order — one kernel, several surfaces (re-frames the epics below as products):**

1. **Claude Code Governance Pack** (plugin) — *v1 / lead*. Packaging + `ai2rules init`
   over the dogfooded `PreToolUse` hooks + `cc-world` manifest, backed by `world-kernel`
   through the gate ABI. Builds on **E13** (esp. **E13.8**) on **E1/E2**.
2. **Safe MCP Proxy** (sidecar) — protocol-level, host-agnostic reach. **E7** + **E13.4**,
   reusing the `safe-mcp-proxy` / `mcp-tool-projection` references.
3. **`harness gate` binary + `world-kernel` crate** (sidecar / library) — for embedders on
   any host. **E13.8 (D24)** + the kernel crates.
4. **Supporting layers** (knowledge / intent / substrate) ship **later**, each as an
   optional sidecar / MCP-server behind a spine contract — never a v1 prerequisite.

## Guiding principles (carried from the architecture)

1. **Kernel, not wrapper** — define the world the agent perceives; don't inspect
   calls after the fact.
2. **Validity by construction** — only a sealed `IntentIR` reaches the kernel;
   only an `ExecutionSpec` reaches the executor.
3. **Deterministic runtime** — no LLM, no I/O, no mutable shared state in the
   kernel; same inputs ⇒ same decision.
4. **Absence over denial** — absent actions don't exist; `ABSENT` ≠ `DENY` ≠
   `UNKNOWN_TO_ONTOLOGY`.
5. **Monotonic taint + provenance** — taint only increases, survives sessions.
6. **Effect ⟂ decision** — `SIMULATE`/`PROXY`/… are effect modes, never verdicts.
7. **Design-time stochastic, runtime deterministic** — LLMs draft manifests;
   humans review; the compiler freezes them.
8. **Fail closed** — `ASK` collapses to `DENY` in `BACKGROUND`; the executor
   refuses anything not in its local closed registry.
9. **Everything is traced and replayable** — append-only, redacted, reproducible.

## How this plan is organized

- Work is grouped into **epics** (`E0`–`E10`); each epic holds **tasks**
  (`E2.3`, …).
- Epics are ordered by dependency / build order and grouped into four
  **milestones** (`M1`–`M4`).
- Status legend: `[ ]` not started · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done.

## Milestones

| Milestone | Theme | Epics | Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| **M1 — Deterministic Core** | Kernel works in simulation | E0, E1, E2, E3, E4 | Vertical slice: `read_file` → kernel → sim executor → trace → replay, all deterministic |
| **M2 — Live Agent** | A real model drives the loop | E5, E6 | One provider proposes through the projected surface; interactive approvals work; background fails closed |
| **M3 — Full Tool Surface** | Real-world capabilities | E7, E9 | MCP + web + scoped capabilities behind one gate; usable interactive CLI/TUI |
| **M4 — Isolation & Hardening** | Production posture | E8, E10, E11, E12, E13 | OS-level sandbox backstop; all acceptance invariants + security scenarios + benchmarks green; visual World Authoring UI for manifest design; establish industry authority via tech blog; dogfood the governance onto the Claude Code host |
| **M5 — Interactive Advocacy** | The product, in the reader's browser | E14, E15 | The real kernel compiled to WASM powers a same-origin, TensorFlow-Playground-class visualization suite — led by the Taint-Flow Simulator — that lets anyone drive the governance live, with CI proving the in-browser verdicts match the native kernel |

## Epics

### E0 — Foundations & Core Contracts
**Goal:** a buildable workspace and the typed contracts every other epic depends
on. **Depends on:** nothing. **Status:** core done; serialization + contributor
docs in progress.

- [x] **E0.1** Rust workspace (`Cargo.toml`, `resolver = "2"`) scaffolded with the
  crate skeleton: `cli-harness`, `agent-core`, `provider-adapters`,
  `world-kernel`, `executor`, `trace-store`, `compiler`, plus a foundational
  **`harness-types`** crate (see note below). Builds clean offline.
- [x] **E0.2** Core contract types defined in `harness-types`: `Perception`,
  `Provenance`, `Taint`/`TaintedValue`/`TaintContext`, `ToolCall`, `Descriptor`,
  `Decision`, `EffectMode`, `ExecutionMode`, `Disposition`, `ExecutionSpec`,
  `ApprovalToken`, `CompiledWorld`, `WorldManifest`. `IntentIR` lives in
  `world-kernel` (it is sealed — see E0.4).
- [x] **E0.3** Failure/outcome taxonomy defined as `BuildError`
  (`UnknownToOntology`, `Absent`, `SchemaViolation`, `CapabilityViolation`,
  `InvariantViolation`, `DescriptorDrift`, `TaintViolation`, `ApprovalRequired`,
  `BudgetExceeded`).
- [x] **E0.4** Structural invariants enforced by the type system: `IntentIR` has
  private fields and no public constructor (only `IRBuilder::build` in
  `world-kernel` can mint one); `CompiledWorld` exposes getters only and is built
  once from `CompiledWorldParts`. Covered by unit tests (absence levels, taint
  carry-through, approval transitions).
- [~] **E0.5** Serialization wired via `serde`/`serde_json` derives on all
  contracts; formats chosen (manifest YAML, trace JSONL). Remaining: the SHA-256
  descriptor/manifest **hashing + versioning scheme** (lands with E1.4).
- [~] **E0.6** CI added (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`: fmt-check, `clippy -D
  warnings`, build, test). Module-boundary rules captured in crate doc comments;
  a dedicated `CONTRIBUTING.md` is still to write.

> **Note — added crate `harness-types`.** A deliberate refinement to E0.1's
> seven-crate list. The shared contracts live in `harness-types` so `executor`,
> `trace-store`, and the adapters can depend on the types **without** depending
> on `world-kernel`. `IntentIR` is the one exception: it stays in `world-kernel`
> so Rust's privacy can *seal* it (only `IRBuilder` constructs it). This keeps
> the dependency graph flowing inward to `harness-types` and satisfies the
> architecture's "keep core contracts language-neutral" rule.

**Exit:** types compile; sealing/immutability enforced and tested; kernel crate
has no I/O or LLM dependencies. **Met** (build + `clippy -D warnings` + 9 unit
tests green offline); E0.5/E0.6 tails tracked above.

---

### E1 — Manifest & Compiler
**Goal:** turn a reviewed manifest into an immutable `CompiledWorld`.
**Depends on:** E0. **Status:** done (M1 progressing).

- [x] **E1.1** `WorldManifest` schema complete in `harness-types`: actors, trust
  channels, data classes, **capability matrix** (`CapabilityGrant`), base actions
  (now with `arg_constraints` + optional `backing`), scoped capabilities,
  taint/transition policies, budgets, observability/redaction.
- [x] **E1.2** Loader + validator in `compiler` (`loader.rs`): `load_yaml` /
  `load_json`; `validate` checks empty `world_id`, duplicate actions, scoped-cap
  name collisions, and unknown base-action references, surfaced via a
  human-readable `CompileError`.
- [x] **E1.3** `compile()` (`compile.rs`): manifest → immutable `CompiledWorld`
  with `world_id` + `manifest_hash`; pure and deterministic.
- [x] **E1.4** Descriptor hashing (`hashing.rs`): real SHA-256 (via `sha2`) over
  JSON-normalized descriptors/manifest, verified against FIPS test vectors;
  closed-ontology + projected-world tables built (projection = full ontology by
  default; dynamic narrowing deferred to E2).
- [x] **E1.5** Default CLI world authored as `crates/compiler/assets/default_world.yaml`
  (all eight base actions + scoped caps `read_repo_file`, `apply_workspace_patch`,
  `run_tests`, `git_commit`), embedded via `include_str!` and exposed through
  `default_cli_world()` / `compile_default()`.
- [x] **E1.6** Hot reload = recompile → a new value; `CompiledWorld` is never
  mutated. Determinism (same manifest ⇒ equal world + hash) and version change
  (changed manifest ⇒ different `manifest_hash`) covered by tests.

**Exit:** the default world compiles to a stable frozen artifact; descriptor
hashes are reproducible; invalid manifests are rejected with clear errors.
**Met** — 13 compiler tests green; full workspace at 22 tests, `clippy -D
warnings` + fmt clean offline.

---

### E2 — World Kernel
**Goal:** the deterministic heart — representability + disposition.
**Depends on:** E0, E1. **The most security-critical epic. Status:** done.

- [x] **E2.1** `IRBuilder`: representability checks (ontology, projection,
  capability, schema, descriptor, hard taint invariant) → sealed `IntentIR` or
  typed failure. (`intent.rs`; `schema.rs` for minimal arg validation.)
- [x] **E2.2** Provenance + monotonic taint engine: primitives stay in
  `harness-types`; the kernel adds `taint::externally_effectful` and reads taint
  structurally at the build seam so it can only increase (incl. cross-session).
- [x] **E2.3** Invariants engine (`invariants.rs`): code-level hard floor (taint
  × side-effect; descriptor-drift gate), run before manifest policy and
  non-overridable by manifest or human approval.
- [x] **E2.4** Disposition evaluation (`disposition.rs`): ordered deterministic
  rules (manifest taint policy → approval → budget → default allow + effect
  mode) → `Decision` + `EffectMode`, first match wins.
- [x] **E2.5** Budget accounting: caller-supplied `BudgetUsage` in `EvalContext`
  (commands, tokens, network, writes) compared against `world.budget()` →
  `REPLAN`. The kernel reads usage; it never accumulates state.
- [x] **E2.6** Determinism guarantee: `build`/`evaluate`/`decide` are pure fns of
  `(intent, context, world)`; a matrix test asserts repeated `decide` is stable.

**Exit:** kernel returns a deterministic outcome for any
`CompiledWorld` + `ToolCall` + context via `decide()`; representability/
disposition split is enforced. Satisfies invariants **1, 2, 3, 6** (and the
invariant-7 taint floor). **Met** — 21 new kernel tests; full workspace at 43,
`clippy -D warnings` + fmt clean offline.

---

### E3 — Execution Boundary
**Goal:** run validated specs behind a hard process boundary. **Depends on:**
E0 (integrates with E2). **Status:** done.

- [x] **E3.1** `Executor` (closed registry) with handlers isolated from policy
  state; the `Handler` trait holds no policy and never decides.
- [x] **E3.2** `run()` accepts only `ExecutionSpec`; an unregistered action is
  refused (`ExecError::Unregistered`), and descriptor drift is caught before any
  handler (`ExecError::DescriptorDrift`).
- [x] **E3.3** Core handlers: `ReadHandler`, `PatchHandler` (structured full-file
  write — real unified-diff parsing deferred, no offline diff crate),
  `CommandHandler` (real subprocess, thread-drained output, deadline + direct
  child kill; process-group kill-tree deferred to E8).
- [x] **E3.4** Effect-mode application: `Execute` / `Simulate` / `Truncate` real;
  `Proxy` / `Sanitize` / `Defer` return `UnsupportedEffectMode` (later epics;
  Sanitize needs E4 redaction).
- [x] **E3.5** Simulation = an `Executor` driven with `Simulate` specs (no
  separate type); no real side effects.
- [x] **E3.6** `run()` returns `TaintedValue<ExecOutput>` (execution results are
  tainted by default).
- [x] **E3.A** Kernel-side spec assembly: `world-kernel::build_execution_spec` +
  `ExecEnv`; `KernelOutcome::Evaluated` now carries the sealed `IntentIR` so an
  `ALLOW` lowers to an `ExecutionSpec`.

**Exit:** core handlers run in sim and real modes; executor rejects non-spec and
unregistered actions; writes constrained to writable roots. Satisfies invariants
**4, 5, 8, 13, 16** (and **11** at the boundary). **Met** — 9 executor tests + 2
kernel round-trip tests; full workspace at 54, `clippy -D warnings` + fmt clean
offline; `kernel_demo` shows the end-to-end round-trip.

---

### E4 — Trace, Audit & Replay
**Goal:** every decision reproducible; secrets never leaked. **Depends on:** E0,
E2, E3. **Completes M1. Status:** done.

- [x] **E4.1** Append-only JSONL trace store (`TraceStore`) with `TraceRecord`s
  (`record.rs`/`store.rs`); Decision + Execution payloads, with enum room for
  perception/projection/proposal/approval stages as E5/E6 wire them.
- [x] **E4.2** Redaction before disk write (`redact.rs`): masks values whose
  key/dotted-path matches a manifest pattern (`*`-glob); reuses
  `world.redaction_patterns()`. Full glob/value semantics deferred.
- [x] **E4.3** Deterministic replay (`replay.rs`): reconstruct inputs, re-run
  `decide`, compare — same world ⇒ `matched == total`.
- [x] **E4.4** Policy-drift report: `drift_report` = replay vs a different world;
  mismatches are the explicit diff.
- [x] **E4.5** Bundle export/import (`bundle.rs`): `Bundle { manifest, records }`
  → JSON; `replay_bundle` recompiles the world and replays offline.
- [ ] **E4.6** (Optional) cross-implementation parity harness (e.g. Rego mirror)
  — deferred.

**Exit:** replay reproduces decisions; redaction holds; the M1 vertical slice
(`read_file` → kernel → sim executor → trace → replay) passes end to end.
Satisfies invariants **14, 15**. **Met** — 9 trace-store tests; full workspace at
63, `clippy -D warnings` + fmt clean offline; `trace_demo` shows
record → redact → replay → drift. **Milestone M1 complete (E0–E4).**

---

### E5 — Provider Adapters & Orchestrator
**Goal:** a real model drives the loop, seeing only the projected surface.
**Depends on:** E0, E2. **Status:** done (offline; live HTTP deferred).

- [x] **E5.1** Neutral result contract: `ToolOutcome` (`provider-adapters`) the
  orchestrator fills and an adapter formats; `ToolCall` (the inbound contract)
  already lived in `harness-types`.
- [x] **E5.2** Anthropic adapter (`anthropic.rs`): `tool_use` → `ToolCall`,
  `tool_definitions` from the projected surface, `format_tool_result`. Pure
  format; no policy.
- [x] **E5.3** Intent mapper (`agent-core/intent.rs`): ontology pre-check
  (`UNKNOWN_TO_ONTOLOGY` vs known); the kernel's `decide` stays authoritative.
- [x] **E5.4** `agent-core` context packing + projected tool surface
  (`context.rs`, via the new `CompiledWorld::projected_actions()`); only projected
  actions are exposed.
- [x] **E5.5** Model loop (`orchestrator.rs`): propose → adapt → `decide` →
  record (E4) → on ALLOW build spec + execute (SIMULATE) → perceive tainted
  result → feed back; a `ModelClient` trait + deterministic `ScriptedModel`
  stand in for an LLM.
- [ ] **E5.6** Additional adapters (OpenAI, Gemini) — deferred. A real Anthropic
  HTTP client is also deferred (feature-gated, out of the offline core).

**Exit:** a model completes a task through projected tools only; one policy gate
regardless of provider; adapters enforce no policy. Reinforces invariants **3**
and **4** (the model only proposes; the kernel alone mints an `ExecutionSpec`).
**Met** — 5 adapter + 6 agent-core tests; full workspace at 74, `clippy -D
warnings` + fmt clean offline; `agent_loop` demo runs a scripted session end to
end.

---

### E6 — Approvals & Execution Modes
**Goal:** human-in-the-loop as durable state; autonomous runs fail closed.
**Depends on:** E2, E3, E4. **Completes M2. Status:** done.

- [x] **E6.1** `ExecutionMode` threaded into `evaluate` (`EvalContext.mode`); an
  approval-required action branches on it.
- [x] **E6.2** Durable `ApprovalStore` (`trace-store/approval.rs`): append-only
  JSONL of lifecycle transitions folded on load; `pending → approved/rejected →
  executed`. Persisted, not in-memory.
- [x] **E6.3** `ASK` lifecycle in the orchestrator: mint a pending token →
  resolve via `ApprovalPolicy` → on approve, re-decide with the grant → `ALLOW`
  → execute → `mark_executed`; reject path surfaces a refusal.
- [x] **E6.4** Binding: `is_granted` matches an Approved token on action +
  params hash + world id + descriptor hash + provenance + effect mode; any drift
  voids reuse.
- [x] **E6.5** `BACKGROUND` fails closed — an approval-required action collapses
  `ASK → DENY` ("background_denies_ask"); no token minted.

**Exit:** interactive approvals resume execution; background denies; tokens
invalidated by drift. Satisfies invariants **9, 10**. **Met** — kernel mode tests
+ 4 store tests (mint/approve/drift/reopen) + orchestrator resume/deny tests;
full workspace at 82, `clippy -D warnings` + fmt clean offline; `approvals_demo`
shows both paths. **Milestone M2 complete (E5–E6).** Decisions logged in
`DECISIONS.md`.

---

### E7 — MCP, Web & Scoped Capabilities
**Goal:** external tools and the web flow through the same gate; broad tools are
narrowed. **Depends on:** E1, E2, E3. **Status:** done (offline mock transports).

- [x] **E7.1** MCP dispatch via `BackingIdentity::McpServer` → `build_execution_spec`
  lowers to a structured `{server,tool,input}` op; the executor's `McpHandler`
  dispatches through a pluggable `McpTransport` (mock; real stdio/HTTP deferred).
- [x] **E7.2** MCP descriptor drift: handlers register under the action's
  descriptor hash; the executor's existing pre-dispatch hash check blocks a stale
  upstream tool (invariant 11).
- [x] **E7.3** Web fetch (`WebHandler` + `WebFetcher`); results are tainted by the
  executor's default, so tainted web can never drive egress (floored at build).
- [x] **E7.4** Scoped-capability machinery in `build_execution_spec`: keep only
  declared `ActorInput` args (strip locked/unknown), inject `Literal`s, resolve
  `ContextRef` from `ExecEnv.context`. `CompiledWorld::scoped_capability` exposes
  the spec.
- [x] **E7.5** Default world ships `read_repo_file`, `apply_workspace_patch`,
  `run_tests`, `git_status`/`git_diff`/`git_commit`, and `call_known_mcp_tool`.

**Exit:** MCP/web run through one gate; tainted MCP/web cannot drive external
effects; scoped-cap stripping verified. Satisfies invariants **7, 11, 12**.
**Met** — spec stripping tests + executor MCP/web/drift tests + loop test; full
workspace at 89, `clippy -D warnings` + fmt clean offline; `tools_demo` shows
all three. E9 adds the interactive CLI and structured decision feedback,
completing **Milestone 3**. Decisions D14–D16 logged.

---

### E8 — Execution Physics (Layer 0 Sandbox)
**Goal:** an OS-level backstop independent of policy. **Depends on:** E3.

- [ ] **E8.1** Isolated working dir + explicit writable roots (writes can't
  escape, enforced at the OS level too).
- [ ] **E8.2** Isolated `HOME`; no ambient host SSH/cloud credentials; env
  allowlist.
- [ ] **E8.3** Network disabled by default + manifest-defined egress exceptions.
- [ ] **E8.4** Subprocess timeout/kill-tree; PTY session ownership +
  cancellation.
- [ ] **E8.5** Pluggable container / gVisor / namespace backend for higher
  isolation.

**Exit:** the sandbox enforces physics even if policy is imperfect; the two are
independent backstops. Hardens invariant **8**.

---

### E9 — CLI / TUI
**Goal:** the user-facing harness. **Depends on:** E5, E6. **Completes M3.**

- [x] **E9.1** Terminal UX: prompt input, streaming output, status. (Basic REPL loop using `inquire`).
- [x] **E9.2** Approval UX surfacing action / reasoning / provenance, with
  one-shot vs manifest-extension paths kept separate. (Using `ApprovalPolicy::Interactive` callback).
- [x] **E9.3** Structured rendering of `ABSENT` / `DENY` / `ASK` / `REPLAN`
  feedback with explicit decision, rule, effect, and operator-facing guidance.
- [x] **E9.4** Session management, world selection, mode toggle. (Via `--world`, `--background` CLI args).
- [x] **E9.5** `--simulate` flag to run against the simulation executor for safe
  demos/tests.

**Exit:** a developer can run the harness interactively against the default world
end to end.
**Met** — `TranscriptEntry` carries structured decision/rule/effect metadata and
`harness` renders governed steps as explicit `Decision`, `Rule`, `Effect`, and
`Feedback` fields. **Milestone 3 complete.**

---

### E10 — Acceptance, Security Scenarios & Benchmarks
**Goal:** prove the invariants and measure security/utility. **Depends on:** all.
**Completes M4.**

- [ ] **E10.1** Encode all 16 acceptance invariants (architecture §14) as a
  deterministic CI test suite.
- [ ] **E10.2** Security scenarios: prompt injection, cross-session zombie taint,
  descriptor drift / rug-pull, exfiltration attempt, dependency poisoning.
- [ ] **E10.3** Determinism + replay regression suite gated in CI.
- [ ] **E10.4** Utility/benchmark harness (AgentDojo-style task × attack pairs)
  reporting attack-success-rate and task utility.
- [ ] **E10.5** Design-time loop tooling: manifest-drafting assistant +
  trace-failure explainer (LLM at design time only).

**Exit:** all invariants green in CI; ASR/utility tracked over time; drift and
regression gates enforced.

---

### E11 — World Authoring Tool (Design-Time UI)
**Goal:** A browser-based visual editor for drafting, testing, and visualizing world manifests with real-time feedback on the resulting tool surface, capability mapping, and security decisions. **Depends on:** E1, E2, E4, E5. **Status:** 🚧 in progress (E11.1–E11.3 done; E11.4–E11.5 pending).

- [x] **E11.1** Single embedded HTML/JS authoring page (no build step; see D18): 3-column layout — YAML manifest editor on the left (plain textarea, auto-previews on input), the effective tool surface in the center, and the kernel's decision matrix on the right. (Live syntax highlighting/linting deferred.)
- [x] **E11.2** Local Rust API endpoint: a `harness serve [--port <N>]` subcommand runs a std-only blocking HTTP server that serves the embedded page plus two JSON endpoints, backed by the **real** compiler + kernel:
  - `GET /api/world/default`: the bundled default manifest YAML (seeds the editor).
  - `POST /api/preview {yaml}`: compiles a draft manifest and returns a parse/compile error, or the projected tool surface (name, base/scoped kind, action/side-effect type, scoped-cap args) plus a per-action decision matrix.
- [x] **E11.3** Live preview UI: renders the projected tool surface and a color-coded clean-vs-tainted decision matrix (ALLOW/ASK/DENY/ABSENT/REPLAN/UNKNOWN + the deciding rule) that updates as the manifest changes. (Collision flags / simulated-execution previews deferred.)
- [ ] **E11.4** Manifest Exporter: Support local download/save of validated YAML manifest files (updating the workspace `.agents/default_world.yaml` if configured).
- [ ] **E11.5** Integration with E10.5: Embed manifest-drafting LLM assistant and trace-failure explainer in the UI (e.g., loading an audit trace file to visually trace a denied action and suggest manifest edits to resolve it).

**Exit:** Developer can start `cli-harness serve`, edit the manifest YAML side-by-side with live compilation and tool-surface preview, and download/commit the result.

---

### E12 — Developer Advocacy & Blog Platform
**Goal:** Establish industry authority in deterministic AI execution via a Google Discover-optimized blog. **Depends on:** M1, M2. **Status:** 🚀 **live at [ai2rules.dev](https://ai2rules.dev)** (Astro site in `blog/`, deployed on Cloudflare Pages, registrar Namecheap — see `blog/DEPLOY.md`). E12.1 + drafts E12.3–E12.5 done & accuracy-reviewed; E12.2 partial (JSON-LD/OG/RSS/sitemap live; WebSub + auto OG-image + AVIF pending); E12.6 (promotion) and Search Console submission pending.

- [x] **E12.1 [Tech]** Scaffold the blog platform: Astro project (MDX, sitemap, RSS, local fonts for Core Web Vitals), `sharp`-based image optimization, and `<meta name="robots" content="max-image-preview:large">`. (Images optimize to WebP today; AVIF output not yet enabled.)
- [ ] **E12.2 [Tech]** Implement SEO & Discovery layer: **Done** — `Article`/`TechArticle` JSON-LD, OpenGraph/Twitter cards (per-post hero image), RSS + sitemap. **Pending** — WebSub/pubsub pinging for instant indexing and automated OG-image generation. (Production `site` set to `https://ai2rules.dev`.)
- [x] **E12.3 [Content]** Draft "Why 'Deny' is Dangerous: The Case for Absent Tools in AI" (Thought Leadership): Focus on the architectural failure of wrappers vs. kernels, and the case for "Absent over Deny." (Stark architectural diagram still TODO.)

### E13 — Harness ↔ Claude Code Integration (dogfooding)
**Goal:** Apply the deterministic governance kernel to the **Claude Code CLI** host via a config-driven gateway, so one `WorldManifest` governs both the *tool surface* (projection / ABSENT) and *per-call decisions* (taint floor, ASK, budgets) — including the native tools an MCP proxy alone can't see. **Depends on:** E1, E2, E7 (+ the `safe-mcp-proxy` / `mcp-tool-projection` references). **Status:** 🚧 in progress.

**Design — Claude Code exposes two enforcement surfaces that mirror the kernel's two stages:**
1. *What tools exist* — a subagent's `tools` allowlist + which MCP tools are connected = **projection / representability / ABSENT** (a tool not on the surface literally cannot be called).
2. *What a call may do, in context* — a **`PreToolUse` hook** returning `permissionDecision: allow|deny|ask` = **`decide()` / disposition**; this is the *only* lever over **native** tools (`Bash`/`Edit`/`Write`/`Read`/`WebFetch`).

One compiled `WorldManifest` drives both: an **MCP shim** (projection + scoped-cap arg-locking) and a **generated hook set** (taint floor, ASK, budgets), plus a **taint sidecar** (a state file the hooks read/write for monotonic, cross-turn taint).

**Value:** an MCP-only proxy can't see native tools — hooks are the only governance there (highest-leverage gap); unifying both under one `CompiledWorld` removes drift across `settings.json` permissions + `.mcp.json` + subagent allowlists + hooks; the sidecar is the only path to cross-tool information-flow control in this host.

**Known friction:** `PreToolUse` hooks gate (allow/deny/ask) but don't reliably *rewrite* native-tool args → scoped-cap arg-locking lives in the MCP shim, native tools are validate-and-deny; taint is heuristic (inferred from which tool touched an untrusted source); subagent allowlists are static → map trust levels onto distinct subagents.

- [x] **E13.1** Scaffold the Flywheel "Correcting Reviewer" as a real subagent (`.claude/agents/correcting-reviewer.md`) + `/review-blog` command (`.claude/commands/review-blog.md`). *[step (a) — commit + push to both remotes]*
- [ ] **E13.2** First slice: a manifest-driven `PreToolUse` hook + taint sidecar that ports the kernel's three signature behaviors onto Claude Code — (1) **ABSENT-for-native** (deny native tools not in the projected set), (2) **taint floor** (once a tainted file/web result is read, deny network/egress), (3) **ASK** on writes / destructive commands. Wire into `settings.json` via the `update-config` skill. *[step (b)]*
- [x] **E13.3** Design `harness compile --target claude-code`: emit `.claude/settings.json` hooks, `.mcp.json` (→ shim), and subagent allowlists from one `WorldManifest` — design + manifest→host mapping recorded in `DECISIONS.md` **D19**. (Emitter implementation is future work; E13.4/E13.5 build it out.) *[step (c)]*
- [ ] **E13.4** *(later)* MCP projection shim for scoped-capability arg-locking, reusing `safe-mcp-proxy` / `mcp-tool-projection`.
- [x] **E13.5** Demo: the first-slice hook neutralizing a prompt-injection → egress attempt (feeds the "Running Claude Code Safely" article + a VHS recording). **Done**: `.claude/hooks/demo-injection-egress.sh` is a self-contained, side-effect-free walk of the classic chain — read an untrusted ticket carrying an injection (in an HTML comment) → session tainted → `WebFetch`/`curl`/`wget` exfil all denied by the taint floor, with a clean-session baseline proving it's the taint, not a URL blocklist. The "Running Claude Code Safely" article gains a *Dogfooding* section with the verified transcript; `.claude/hooks/demo-injection-egress.tape` renders the recording to `blog/src/assets/demo-injection-egress.gif` once `vhs` is installed.
- [x] **E13.6** Cross-agent taint propagation: make taint follow the subagent↔parent information-flow edge (a tainted subagent taints its parent; a tainted parent seeds its child). The E13.2 POC keys taint by `session_id`, and subagents get their own — so a subagent can launder untrusted data back to the parent (the ZombieAgent pattern, intra-run): a **fail-open** gap. Empirically confirm subagent session/linkage semantics, implement propagation via `SubagentStop` (and/or PreToolUse parent linkage), ship a runnable demo, and write a case-study article. **Done** (see DECISIONS **D20**): the experiment showed Claude Code shares one in-process `session_id` across the agent tree, so taint already propagates parent↔subagent via the shared sidecar; added `taint-notify.py` (SubagentStop: observability + distinct-session union), `demo-cross-agent.sh`, and the article `subagent-taint-experiment.md`. Isolated/background/remote agents (distinct session + `.claude/state`) remain a documented limitation.

- [x] **E13.7** Containerized **governed Claude Code** SUT (`docker/`): a throwaway Claude Code instance running the repo's PreToolUse governance under OS-level isolation — separates the agent-under-test from the host dev session, and provides the **E8** enforcement floor (network egress policy, non-root, dropped caps, write confinement) the hooks' decisions need. A shared named-volume taint store is the cross-instance fix for the local sidecar's locality limit (D20). Image + `run.sh` + README shipped; the live **egress-allowlist proxy** (the full E8 network floor) is shipped + verified in `docker/compose.yaml` + `docker/egress-proxy/` — the agent runs on an internal no-gateway network whose only egress is a tinyproxy allowlisting `anthropic.com`. See DECISIONS **D21**. *(advances E8)*

- [ ] **E13.8** Host-neutral **gate ABI** — the integration port that makes the kernel host-independent (see DECISIONS **D24**, `docs/harness-gate-abi.md`). A `harness gate --world <manifest>` subcommand reads a `GateRequest` JSON on stdin and writes the kernel's verdict (`ABSENT/ALLOW/DENY/ASK/REPLAN` + rule + post-call taint) on stdout, so every host (Claude Code, a Hermes agent, Codex CLI, an MCP proxy) integrates through a **thin adapter calling the real kernel** — not a per-host reimplementation. **Done**: (1) the pure `harness_preview::gate()` (12 tests) + the `harness gate` subcommand honoring the ABI exit-code contract (verdict on stdout, exit 0 even for DENY/ASK; bad input/manifest → 2), verified end-to-end; (2) migrated the Claude Code world to a real `WorldManifest` (`.claude/cc-world.yaml`), with `Bash` adapter-classified into `Bash`/`Bash_network`/`Bash_destructive` (DECISIONS **D25**) — verified the taint floor, ASK, and ABSENT verdicts come from the real kernel; (3) built the host adapter shim (`.claude/hooks/world-gate-adapter.py`, DECISIONS **D26**) — pure plumbing calling `harness gate` (no decision logic), validated in isolation by `test-gate-adapter.sh` (taint floor incl. classified Bash-curl, ASK on `rm -rf`, escalation) with the live host hook left untouched. **Pending**: wire the adapter into the E13.7 container SUT (ship the `harness` binary in the image) + run the in-container injection→egress dogfood; opt-in cutover of the live host hook (retiring `world-gate.py`/`cc-world.json`); the native↔wasm gate golden-vector conformance guard (E14.4); and path-based read-taint (deferred design item, D25). Separately, **trust pins** (DECISIONS **D29**, `docs/trust-pins.md`) landed in the live hook: operator attestations pinned to content identity that re-classify a vouched read source as Trusted (drift re-taints), turning the taint sidecar into a recomputed cause-ledger (shared logic in `.claude/hooks/_gatelib.py`, validated by `test-gate.sh` §4) — the canonical `trust_pins` field on the compiled `WorldManifest` + pure `gate()` follows with the host cutover, and it resolves D25's deferred read-taint (a pin is the Trusted-channel exception to an untrusted read).

Relates to acceptance invariants 2 (ABSENT-over-DENY), 6/7 (monotonic taint × side-effect floor), 9/10 (approval / fail-closed) — re-proved on the Claude Code host.

### E14 — In-Browser Kernel (WASM playground)
**Goal:** Compile the **real** pure kernel + compiler to WebAssembly so the decision logic runs **client-side, same-origin** — the shared engine under the interactive visualization suite (**E15**) and a serverless authoring preview (E11), with no backend and no reimplementation of governance in JS. Because in-browser demos must run the *actual* kernel (not a drift-prone JS port), and the kernel is pure by design (no I/O / LLM / mutable state; deps are `serde`/`sha2`/`shell-words` — all wasm-clean), this is a packaging exercise, not a rewrite. **Depends on:** E1, E2 (and reuses the E11.2 `/api/preview` request/response shape). **Status:** 🚧 in progress — engine spike **validated** (the real kernel decides in wasm from JS). See DECISIONS **D22**.

- [x] **E14.1** `harness-wasm` crate (`cdylib` + `rlib`, `wasm-bindgen`) exposing a JSON-string surface over the real compiler + kernel — `preview(yaml)` (mirrors E11.2 `POST /api/preview`), `default_world()`, `version()`; parse/compile failures come back as `{ok:false,error}` rather than throwing. **Done**: to avoid the JS-drift trap (D22), the pure `preview` was first extracted into a shared `harness-preview` crate now used by *both* `harness serve` and `harness-wasm`, so there is one implementation.
- [x] **E14.2** Build pipeline: `wasm-pack build --target web --release` with `wasm-opt -Oz` (set in `harness-wasm`'s `Cargo.toml`) produces JS glue + a size-optimized `.wasm` — **2.7 MB debug → 480 KB release** (~150–200 KB gz, under the ~300 KB gz target). The artifact is emitted into `blog/public/vendor/harness-wasm/` (committed, so it ships with the Cloudflare Pages deploy). A `--target nodejs` build also feeds `smoke-test.cjs`. *(A CI step to rebuild/verify the wasm on kernel changes is folded into E14.4.)*
- [x] **E14.3** Bridge island in the browser: a `--target web` wasm bundle + `KernelPlayground.astro` + a `/playground` page that compiles the manifest and renders the live clean-vs-tainted decision matrix client-side. **Done & verified in a real browser** (the kernel decides in-tab: tainted `fetch_web`/`call_mcp_tool`/`update_memory` → Deny `taint_invariant`, `start_pty` → Ask, reads/patches → Allow). Also shipped a headless equivalent (`crates/harness-wasm/smoke-test.cjs`). The wasm artifact is currently a local debug build (gitignored) pending the E14.2 release/emit pipeline; the *polished* visualizations build on this in **E15**.
- [ ] **E14.4** Fidelity guard: a shared golden-vector suite (manifest+event → expected decision) run against **both** the native kernel and the wasm build in CI, so the in-browser demo can never silently drift from the product. *(The Node smoke test is a precursor; the cross-build CI vector suite remains.)*
- [ ] **E14.5** *(stretch)* Fold the same bundle into E11 so `harness serve`'s live preview can run fully client-side (static hosting), keeping the Rust HTTP server only as an optional local convenience.

**Exit:** A reader on `ai2rules.dev` can drive the real kernel — edit a world, fire an event, see the deterministic verdict — with nothing leaving their browser, and CI proves the wasm verdicts match the native kernel byte-for-byte.

---

### E15 — Interactive Visualization Suite ("Harness Playground")
**Goal:** A family of TensorFlow-Playground-class, in-browser, same-origin interactive visualizations that make the kernel's behaviour *visceral* — every one driven by the real WASM kernel (E14), so the picture is always the product, never a mock. Shipped as reusable Astro islands embeddable across the blog and gathered on a `/playground` hub. The visualizations are the differentiator; the engine (E14) is shared. **Depends on:** E14 (engine), E12 (blog surface). **Status:** 📋 planned — first deliverable is the **Taint-Flow Simulator** (E15.2). Builds on DECISIONS **D22**.

- [ ] **E15.1** Shared substrate ("skins over one engine"): a typed wasm-bridge wrapper (load-once `decide` / `compile_preview`), the canonical decision-state design language (ALLOW green · ASK amber · DENY red · ABSENT grey · REPLAN violet · taint = red wash), a scenario + manifest loader, and a common island shell with the accessible-fallback contract — so each visualization is a *view*, not a re-implementation.
- [ ] **E15.2 [first deliverable]** **Taint-Flow Simulator** — an agent *session as an animated timeline*. The reader composes or picks a sequence of tool-calls (Read, Edit, WebFetch, Bash …); pressing ▶ runs each step through the real kernel; the UI animates the **monotonic taint floor** rising the instant an untrusted source is read and **severing every later network edge** (DENY + the deciding rule). Direct manipulation: reorder / insert / remove steps and watch decisions re-flip live; toggle the manifest's taint/egress policy; load presets (incl. the prompt-injection → egress attack). Embeds into "Running Claude Code Safely" in place of the asciinema *playback*, with the table transcript retained as the no-JS / SEO fallback (E12.7 increment 2).
- [ ] **E15.3** **Decision-Matrix Playground** — manifest editor ↔ a live action × {clean, tainted} ALLOW/ASK/DENY/ABSENT grid; the public, polished evolution of the E11 authoring tool (candidate to *unify* with E11 once E14.5 lands).
- [ ] **E15.4** **Attack Sandbox (with / without physics)** — an editable prompt-injection payload run side-by-side: ungoverned (secrets exfiltrate) vs governed (egress severed at the taint floor); the persuasion piece, paired with "Why Deny is Dangerous" / "AI Aikido".
- [ ] **E15.5** **Provenance Flow Graph** — an animated information-flow DAG (data + tool-call nodes) coloured by provenance / taint; untrusted reads spread "red" through the session and break proposed network edges. Shares its scenario model with E15.2.
- [ ] **E15.6** **`/playground` hub + embeds** — a gallery page on `ai2rules.dev` indexing the visualizations, each cross-linked from the post it illustrates (a destination plus an internal-link / SEO surface).

**Exit:** `ai2rules.dev/playground` hosts several real-kernel-backed interactive visualizations — led by the Taint-Flow Simulator embedded in the sandbox guide — each running entirely in the reader's browser and each provably faithful via the E14 fidelity guard.

### E16 — Internal demo: governed JIRA MCP on Copilot + Claude Code  🔝 HIGH PRIORITY
**Goal:** A live internal demo showing **one governance manifest shaping the capability
surface of the Atlassian/JIRA MCP** across **GitHub Copilot (VS Code + JetBrains)** and
**Claude Code** — read + comment only, scope arg-locked to a specific project, every
destructive JIRA tool **ABSENT** (doesn't exist for the agent). The line it sells:
*"I can give Copilot JIRA access and not worry about an accidental destructive action."*
**Depends on:** E7 + `repos/safe-mcp-proxy` (Atlassian passthrough) + the gate ABI (D24).
**Approach:** D32 — govern via the **MCP surface** (Copilot exposes no native per-call
gate; MCP is where it *is* governable, and it's host-agnostic — one proxy, three hosts).
**Status:** 🚧 in progress — top near-term priority. **E16.1 compose glue done & tested**;
remaining is real-JIRA validation, the demo manifest tailoring, host wiring, and the
runbook.

- [~] **E16.1** Compose glue + validation. **Done:** built `safe_mcp_proxy.mcp_gateway`
  (in the `safe-mcp-proxy` repo) — a host-facing stdio MCP server composing
  `ManifestPolicyEngine` (ABSENT / arg_rules / taint) + `UpstreamConnector` (real MCP
  client): ABSENT-filters `tools/list` to the manifest allowlist, gates `tools/call`,
  forwards only ALLOW upstream, audits decisions; `run-proxy.sh` launches it. Verified by
  12 tests incl. a real end-to-end (gateway ⇄ UpstreamConnector ⇄ bundled upstream); full
  suite 550 OK. **Pending:** validate against a **real** Atlassian Remote MCP Server /
  sandbox JIRA — confirm tool-list shaping, a real read + comment, a blocked destructive
  (ABSENT), and scope lock. *(Needs: JIRA instance + auth, project key(s), read/comment set.)*
- [ ] **E16.2** Author the **demo manifest** (tailored from `manifests/atlassian_mvp.yaml`):
  allow JIRA read tools + `jira_add_comment`; **ABSENT** every write/destructive tool
  (delete, bulk, create/update/transition/assign); **arg-lock scope** to the project
  key(s) — JQL constrained + issue-key prefix check on comment.
- [ ] **E16.3** **Host wiring:** VS Code Copilot (`.vscode/mcp.json`), JetBrains Copilot
  MCP config, and Claude Code (`.mcp.json`) all pointing at the proxy as the JIRA gateway
  — one proxy governs all three.
- [ ] **E16.4** **Demo runbook + script** (`docs/demos/jira-copilot.md`): the before/after
  (ungoverned full JIRA surface vs. shaped surface), the "ask Copilot to delete an issue →
  the tool doesn't exist" beat, the audit dashboard as the visual, and Claude Code parity
  on the same manifest. Plus a recorded fallback (asciinema / screen capture).
- [ ] **E16.5** *(advocacy)* "Broader Claude Code use" framing — show CC governed by the
  same manifest; cross-link the relevant blog posts.
- [ ] **E16.6** *(stretch / productization, not a demo blocker)* Route the proxy's
  decisions through the **real kernel** via the gate ABI (advances **E13.4**) so the demo
  proxy *is* the product kernel, not a parallel Python engine — or ship a parity note.

**Exit:** a repeatable live demo (and a recording) on VS Code Copilot + JetBrains Copilot
+ Claude Code where the JIRA MCP surface is shaped by one manifest — destructive actions
ABSENT, scope project-locked, every call audited.

Relates to acceptance invariants 2 (ABSENT-over-DENY), 7 (taint × side-effect floor),
11 (descriptor drift), 12 (scoped caps strip locked args) — re-proved on Copilot.

## Acceptance invariant coverage

Traceability from the architecture's 16 acceptance invariants to the epic that
delivers each (and the epic that hardens it).

| # | Invariant (abbreviated) | Primary | Hardened by |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Unknown actions cannot form `IntentIR` | E2 | E10 |
| 2 | Known-but-non-projected → `ABSENT`, not `DENY` | E2 | E10 |
| 3 | `UNKNOWN_TO_ONTOLOGY` distinct from `ABSENT` | E2 | E5 |
| 4 | Model cannot invoke an executor directly | E3 | E10 |
| 5 | Only `ExecutionSpec` crosses into execution | E3 | E10 |
| 6 | Taint never decreases (incl. across sessions) | E2 | E10 |
| 7 | Tainted file/web/MCP/shell can't drive egress/cred/memory/external | E2 | E7 |
| 8 | Writes can't escape writable roots | E3 | E8 |
| 9 | Destructive commands require approval | E6 | E10 |
| 10 | Approval-required in background denies | E6 | E10 |
| 11 | Descriptor drift blocks before handler | E1 | E7 |
| 12 | Scoped caps strip locked args before injecting literals | E7 | E10 |
| 13 | `ALLOW + SIMULATE` has no real side effect | E3 | E10 |
| 14 | Replay with same world reproduces the decision | E4 | E10 |
| 15 | Redaction keeps secrets out of audit logs | E4 | E10 |
| 16 | Executor refuses actions absent from its local registry | E3 | E10 |

## Out of scope (for now)

- Multi-agent / sub-agent orchestration beyond a single agent loop.
- Hosted/remote control plane, multi-tenant deployment, web dashboards.
- Resolving semantic ambiguity ("forward this to Alex") — an acknowledged open
  problem, not a deliverable.
- Non-CLI surfaces (IDE/browser extensions).

## Next step

This plan is decomposed just-in-time as each milestone approaches. The immediate
next todo:

- **Wire the real `context-engine` retriever behind the MCP transport** in the
  cross-layer thesis demo (`agent-core/examples/poisoned_knowledge_demo`),
  replacing the mock `MockMcpTransport`. Today the poisoned document is scripted;
  the goal is for it to be a genuinely distilled document served by
  `context-engine`'s MCP endpoint, so the demo shows *two real systems composing*
  (knowledge layer → action layer) rather than a faithful model. See
  [`docs/THESIS.md`](docs/THESIS.md) §7 and `DECISIONS.md` D23. The umbrella-repo
  *form* stays deferred until this demo reveals the natural structure.
