# D24 — Hosts reach the kernel through a host-neutral process ABI (`harness gate`), via thin adapters — never reimplementation

- **Epic:** E13/E14 (integration port; refines D19) · **Status:** Accepted (design; implementation pending)
- **Decision:** Make the governance kernel **host-independent** by exposing it as a
  single neutral **process ABI** and integrating every host through a **thin host
  adapter** that calls it — never by re-deriving governance in the host's language.
  Concretely:
  - A `harness gate` subcommand reads one **GateRequest** JSON on stdin and writes
    one **GateResponse** JSON on stdout (schema: [`docs/harness-gate-abi.md`](../docs/harness-gate-abi.md)).
    It is **decision-only** — `ABSENT/ALLOW/DENY/ASK/REPLAN` + the rule that fired +
    the post-call monotonic taint state to persist — and never executes (the host
    runs its own tool on `ALLOW`).
  - The decision is a **pure** `gate(&CompiledWorld, GateRequest) -> GateResponse`
    living beside `preview()` in `harness-preview`, so it is the *same* code natively
    and in WASM (extends the E14.4 native↔wasm conformance guard to gate verdicts).
  - A **host adapter** per host is a thin shim: map the host's intercept event →
    GateRequest, restore/persist monotonic taint (sidecar), map GateResponse → the
    host's decision shape. The process **exit code answers "did the gate evaluate?"**
    (0) vs "failed" (≠0; the adapter chooses fail-open/closed) — it does **not**
    encode the verdict.
  - The **MCP proxy** is one such adapter that taps the MCP wire, governing any
    MCP-speaking host with no per-host code (MCP-routed tools only, not native tools).
- **Consequence (the property we wanted):** supporting a new host of the same
  effect-class (Claude Code, a Hermes agent, Codex CLI) = **one adapter + one world
  manifest, with the kernel binary byte-identical.** Two adapters is not a kernel
  change; the kernel stays the single deterministic source of truth across every
  constellation.
- **Refines D19 / supersedes the E13.2 slice:** D19 already says the hook runs "the
  runtime `decide()` gate" and rejects JS/TS reimplementation — it just never named
  the mechanism, and `world-gate.py` shipped as a **Python reimplementation** of
  ABSENT/taint/ASK, contradicting both D19's intent and D22's "one source of truth."
  This ABI is that mechanism: the hook collapses to a ~15-line adapter calling
  `harness gate`, and the governance rules (incl. taint sources) move out of Python
  into the compiled `WorldManifest`.
- **Alternatives:** (a) **adopt a generator (MetaHarness/`agent-harness-generator`)
  as the foundation** — rejected: it is a *packaging factory* (scaffolds branded
  agent packages with policy/release gates), a layer *above* this stack, not a
  deterministic runtime kernel; at most a distribution channel that could itself
  call this ABI. (b) **fork a host (Claude Code / a Hermes agent) and build
  governance in** — rejected: couples us to one host's release treadmill and makes
  us *become* a host, forfeiting the neutrality that is the whole goal. (c)
  **per-host reimplementation** (today's Python hook; a future JS port for the next
  host) — rejected: N drifting copies, kernel not actually deciding — the exact
  failure D17/D18/D22 exist to close. (d) **in-process linking only** (every host
  links the Rust lib) — rejected as the *sole* path: fine for a Rust host, but
  impossible for a Python hook or a TS host; the process ABI is the
  lowest-common-denominator that *also* subsumes the library and WASM embeddings.
  (e) **encode the verdict in the exit code** — rejected: overloads "process failed"
  with "DENY" and bakes one host's hook convention into a host-neutral ABI; the
  adapter owns that translation.
- **Why:** the kernel is already pure (`decide(world, call, prov, ctx)`) and reached
  only through a neutral contract, so a stdin/stdout JSON ABI is a *packaging*
  exercise, not new logic — and it is the one move that makes "same kernel across
  many constellations" *true* rather than aspirational, ends the
  reimplementation-drift class for good, and unifies native, WASM, hook, and proxy
  behind one conformance-tested decision function.
- **Known limit (inherited from D19/D20):** on hosts where `PreToolUse` can't
  rewrite args, scoped-cap arg-locking stays validate-and-deny via the MCP shim, and
  taint remains heuristic (per-tool/per-path) because the host exposes no in-data
  provenance — the ABI *relocates* that heuristic from Python into the compiled
  world; it does not make it exact.
