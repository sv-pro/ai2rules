# D5 — Pragmatic-real execution handlers

- **Epic:** E3 · **Status:** Accepted
- **Decision:** `read` real (readable-root checked); `apply_patch` as a structured
  full-file write (writable-root enforced); `run_command` real via std subprocess
  with a thread-drained deadline + direct-child kill; `SIMULATE` for all.
- **Alternatives:** Simulation-first (EXECUTE stubbed); full-real (unified-diff
  apply + process-group kill-tree now).
- **Why:** Offline-buildable (no diff crate available); process-group kill-tree
  and OS isolation are E8's job, not E3's.
