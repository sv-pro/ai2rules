# D22 — Interactive demos run the real kernel via WASM, served same-origin

- **Epic:** E14 / E12 / E11 · **Status:** Accepted (direction); implementation planned
- **Decision:** Make live, interactive demos on `ai2rules.dev` run the **actual**
  kernel + compiler compiled to WebAssembly, shipped as a static Astro island —
  so the decision logic executes client-side, same-origin, with no backend and no
  reimplementation of governance. As an **interim** (no wasm yet), ship recorded
  interactivity via a **self-hosted asciinema player** (player vendored under
  `blog/public/vendor/`, casts under `blog/public/casts/`) — playback, but still
  same-origin and faithful to a real run.
- **Alternatives:** (a) **reimplement the gate/kernel in TypeScript** — fast and
  tiny, but a second copy of the decision logic that will drift from the Rust
  source, which is fatal for a product whose whole claim is "one deterministic
  source of truth"; (b) **Pyodide running `world-gate.py` unmodified** — faithful
  and zero-rewrite, but a ~6–10 MB runtime download; (c) **self-hosted
  `harness serve` backend behind a reverse proxy** — real binary and arbitrary
  input, but arbitrary input → a real binary reintroduces the exact blast radius
  the harness exists to contain (would itself need the E13.7 governed container);
  (d) **third-party playground** (StackBlitz/Codespaces) — violates the
  same-origin / no-domain-leaving requirement outright.
- **Why:** the kernel is pure by design (no I/O, no LLM, no mutable state) and its
  deps are wasm-clean (`serde_json`/`serde_yaml`/`sha2`/`shell-words`), so wasm is
  a packaging exercise, not a rewrite — and it is the only option that is at once
  same-origin, fully interactive, backend-free, and **provably the real kernel**
  (a CI golden-vector suite, E14.4, pins wasm verdicts to the native kernel). The
  asciinema interim buys an honest same-origin demo today without betting the
  fidelity story on a hand-written JS port.
- **Spike (validated):** the pure `preview` was extracted into a shared
  `harness-preview` crate (used by both `harness serve` and a new `harness-wasm`
  `wasm-bindgen` crate), `wasm-pack build --target nodejs` compiled the whole
  stack (sha2 / serde_yaml / kernel / compiler) to `wasm32`, and a Node smoke
  test (`crates/harness-wasm/smoke-test.cjs`) confirmed the kernel decides
  client-side — clean `fetch_web` → Allow, tainted → Deny (`taint_invariant`).
  The premise holds: no JS reimplementation, one shared implementation, real
  verdicts in the browser runtime. (Debug `.wasm` is ~2.7 MB; release + `wasm-opt`
  size tuning is E14.2.)
