# D11 — Model proposals carry Trusted provenance; taint is the containment

- **Epic:** E5 · **Status:** Accepted
- **Decision:** The orchestrator proposes with the developer's (Trusted)
  authority; containment of tainted-data-driven actions comes from the **taint**
  carried in `EvalContext`, not from lowering the proposal's trust.
- **Alternatives:** Give model proposals a low trust level.
- **Why:** Low trust would make every non-read action `ABSENT` by capability,
  defeating the loop; taint × side-effect is the correct containment mechanism.
