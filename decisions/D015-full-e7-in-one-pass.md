# D15 — Full E7 in one pass

- **Epic:** E7 · **Status:** Accepted
- **Decision:** Ship scoped-capability machinery (E7.4/E7.5, invariant 12) + MCP
  dispatch (E7.1) + MCP descriptor drift (E7.2) + web channel (E7.3) together,
  via the mock transports; plus `git_status`/`git_diff` and `call_known_mcp_tool`.
- **Alternatives:** Scoped caps + drift only, deferring live MCP/web handlers.
- **Why:** With mock transports the whole epic is deterministic and offline, so
  there's no reason to split; satisfies invariants 7, 11, 12 in one move.
