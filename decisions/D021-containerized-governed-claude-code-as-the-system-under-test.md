# D21 — Containerized "governed Claude Code" as the system under test + E8 floor

- **Epic:** E13 / E8 · **Status:** Accepted
- **Decision:** Ship a containerized Claude Code (`docker/Dockerfile` + `run.sh` +
  README) that runs the repo's PreToolUse governance under OS-level isolation.
  Two roles: (1) **separation** — the agent under test and the dogfooding config
  live in a throwaway container, not the host dev session; (2) **enforcement
  floor (E8)** — the container physically enforces what the hooks merely decide
  (network egress policy, non-root, `--cap-drop ALL`, write confinement via
  mounts). Network is the egress floor: `none` (offline, default), `bridge` (live,
  hook-only), or an egress-allowlist proxy (live + contained — the real E8). A
  shared named-volume taint store carries taint across instances (the D20 fix when
  locality breaks).
- **Alternatives:** a single host instance (status quo — conflates SUT and dev,
  no OS floor); a VM / microVM (heavier isolation, slower loop); hooks only (no OS
  enforcement — decisions without physics).
- **Why:** the container is where the harness's *declared* network-disable /
  writable-roots constraints become *enforced*, and it keeps experiments
  (restricting tools, triggering taint, running injection→egress attacks) out of
  the session you develop in. Decisions (hooks) + physics (container) = defense in
  depth.
- **Live-contained floor (shipped):** `docker/compose.yaml` + `docker/egress-proxy/`
  put the agent on an `internal` no-gateway network whose only egress is a
  tinyproxy that allowlists `anthropic.com` (CONNECT :443). Verified: from the
  agent, `api.anthropic.com` connects (HTTP 401), `example.com` is denied by the
  proxy, and bypassing the proxy env has no route. `--network none` (run.sh) still
  blocks the model API entirely, so that mode stays offline-only.
