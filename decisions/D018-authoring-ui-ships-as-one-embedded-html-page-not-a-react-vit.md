# D18 — Authoring UI ships as one embedded HTML page, not a React/Vite SPA

- **Epic:** E11 · **Status:** Accepted · **Refines:** D17
- **Decision:** `harness serve` hosts the World Authoring Tool as a single static
  HTML/JS page (`crates/cli-harness/src/ui.html`, embedded via `include_str!`)
  served by a tiny std-only **blocking** HTTP server (`cli-harness/src/serve.rs`)
  over two JSON endpoints. No JavaScript framework, build step, or runtime
  dependency; the page is vanilla JS and the binary embeds it.
- **Alternatives:** The React/Vite SPA of D17; a Rust TUI; an async HTTP stack
  (axum/tokio) for the API.
- **Why:** D17's core decision — preview through the *real* compiler/kernel via a
  thin Rust HTTP API (100% fidelity, no governance logic reimplemented) — is
  unchanged and met. But a React/Vite SPA would drag a Node toolchain,
  `node_modules`, and a second package ecosystem into a Rust repo whose whole
  posture is lean/offline/no-extra-deps, and an async server would add
  tokio/axum for a single-user localhost tool. One vanilla page over a blocking
  std listener delivers the same 3-column editor / surface / decision-matrix UX
  with zero new dependencies and nothing to build. The richer SPA (and the
  deferred E11.4 export / E11.5 LLM-assist features) can be reintroduced later if
  the UI outgrows a single file.
